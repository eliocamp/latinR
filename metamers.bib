  abstract = {Datasets which are identical over a number of statistical properties, yet produce dissimilar graphs, are frequently used to illustrate the importance of graphical representations when exploring data. This paper presents a novel method for generating such datasets, along with several examples. Our technique varies from previous approaches in that new datasets are iteratively generated from a seed dataset through random perturbations of individual data points, and can be directed towards a desired outcome through a simulated annealing optimization strategy. Our method has the beneﬁt of being agnostic to the particular statistical properties that are to remain constant between the datasets, and allows for control over the graphical appearance of resulting output.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a simple computational procedure for generating ‘matching’ or ‘cloning’ datasets so that they have exactly the same ﬁtted multiple linear regression equation. The method is simple to implement and provides an alternative to generating datasets under an assumed model. The advantage is that, unlike the case for the straight model-based alternative, parameter estimates from the original data and the generated data do not include any model error. This distinction suggests that ‘same ﬁt’ procedures may provide a general and useful alternative to model-based procedures, and have a wide range of applications. For example, as well as being useful for teaching, cloned datasets can provide a model-free way of conﬁdentializing data.},

  abstract = {Moment problems, with finite, preassigned support, regarding the probability distribution, are formulated and used to obtain sharp lower and upper bounds for unknown probabilities and expectations of convex functions of discrete random variables. The bounds are optimum values of special linear programming problems. Simple derivations, based on Lagrange polynomials, are presented for the dual feasible basis structure theorems in case of the power and binomial moment problems. The sharp bounds are obtained by dual type algorithms and formulas. They are analoguous to the Chebyshev-Markov inequalities.},
